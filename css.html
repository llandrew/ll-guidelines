  <h2>Syntax and Formatting</h2>

  <h3>Titles</h3>
  <p>Have a title at the top of each file. Make sure titles are brief yet relevant
  to the content contained within.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
/**
 * Search Modules
 */
</code></pre>
  
  <h3>Multi-line</h3>
  <p>Very rarely will you run into an instance where a single line declaration is
  more appropriate than a multi-line declaration. The only time a single line declaration
  makes sense is for things such as helper classes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
/**
 * Multi-line
 */

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.bordered {
  border-top: 2px solid white;
  border-bottom: 2px solid white;
}

/**
 * Single Line
 */

.bold { font-weight: 700; }
.hidden { display: none !important; }
</code></pre>

  <h2>Naming</h2>

  <h3>Syntax</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Words should be seperated by dashes (e.g. my-new-class), not Camel Case (e.g. myNewClass) or Snake Case (e.g. my_new_class).</li>
    <li>Names should be based on the B.E.M. (Block Element Modifier) convention. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/"><em>BEM 101 - CSS Tricks</em></a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Portability</h3>

    <p>Avoid naming classes based on specific content. Describe what the class is, instead.</p>

    <h4>Bad...</h4>

    <pre><code class="language-css">.affiliated-logos {}</code></pre>

    <h4>Better</h4>

    <pre><code class="language-css">.slider {}</code></pre>
  
    <p>Don't include elements in selectors.</p>
    
    <h4>Bad...</h4>

    <pre><code class="language-css">button.btn {}</code></pre>

    <h4>Better</h4>

    <pre><code class="language-css">.btn {}</code></pre>

    <h3>Picking a Name</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Select what you want explicitly, rather than relying on circumstance or coincidence. Good Selector
        Intent will rein in the reach and lead of your styles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write selectors for resuability, so that you can work more efficiently and reduce waste and repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not nest selectors unnecessarily, because this will increase specificity and effect where else you can use your styles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not qualify selectors unnecessarily, as this will impact the number of different elements
        you can apply styles to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep selectors as short as possible, in order to keep specificity down and performance up.
      </li>
    </ul>
